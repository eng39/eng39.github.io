    <p>Animating is the goal career. This project showed me the basics of 2D aniamtion. I took my octopus fisherman from the Vector Project and gave him a friend. Craboo, if you watch We Bare Bears, is my arch nemesis. I hate him. I am most proud of this project and found it the most satisfying to acomplish. I will take these skills with me and self motivate myself to create better animations.
